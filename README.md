# e-CommercePlatform

This project is a simple e-commerce platform where users can view products, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and search for products. The product data is fetched from the Fake Store API.

# WebPage Walkthrough
Once the webpage is running, here is how you can use it:

a. View Products
Products are fetched from the Fake Store API and displayed on the homepage in a grid format.
Each product card shows the image, name, rating, and price of the product.

b. Search for Products
At the top of the product list, there is a search bar where you can type the name of the product you are looking for.
As you type in the search field, the product list is dynamically filtered to display matching products.

c. Add Products to Cart
Each product card has an "Add to Cart" button.
Click on the button to add the product to the cart. If the product is already in the cart, the quantity will increase by one.

d. View and Manage Cart
The cart can be viewed at the bottom of the page.
Each cart item shows the product image, title, price, and quantity.

e. Update Product Quantity
In the cart, you can increase or decrease the quantity of each item using the + and - buttons.
You cannot decrease the quantity below 1. If you wish to remove the item from the cart entirely, use the "Remove" button.

f. Remove Products from Cart
Use the "Remove" button to completely remove an item from the cart.

g. Price Calculation
The total price for all the items in the cart is displayed under "Price Details."
There is a discount and some additional fees added to give the final total.
Click the "Place Order" button to simulate the checkout process.
